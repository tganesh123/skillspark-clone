        At Skill Spark, we are building skill-oriented courses and hands-on
        training modules that perfectly complement the academic curriculum to
        prepare undergrads to make the best of their education from day one.

      <p>
        We have spent years in various industries sorting through thousands of
        CVs and hiring people that required enormous training and investment in
        almost every industry. Our years of experienceâ€”training and shaping
        graduates for our own companies led us to identify huge gaps between the
        academic curriculum and the industry requirement.
